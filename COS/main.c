Respected Sir.
Thank you for such a great offer.I would really love to take over this opportunity. But before accepting I want to make sure of a few things.
I really would like to either participate in Google Summer of Code or to take an Internship in the next Summer.I would like to know that would that be possible. I would also like to know about the topics on which we would be conducting the workshops. Also would I be able to get a summer break for my Internship, as I will not be in Sri City at that time.
Can you please clear these doubts for me. It would be really helpful.

Thank You.

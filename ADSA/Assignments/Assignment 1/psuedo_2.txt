Algorithm I: Time Complexity O(n^2)
This Program will check how many unique no of pairs of students will be 
available onilne based on thier entry and exit times

The Algorithm Uses Two Nested Loops Which Go over N times

Input:
n <= total no of students 
people <= [(entry, exit), ...]  Array defining a students' entry/exit time

no_of_pairs <= 0

FOR i from 0 to n - 1:
    FOR j from (i+1) to n - 1:
        IF (person1.entry < person2.exit && person2.entry < person1.exit):
        Increment no_of_pairs by 1



Algorithm II: Time Complexity O(n*log(n))
This Program will check how many unique no of pairs of students will be 
available onilne based on thier entry and exit times

The First Part of the Problem User MERGESORT which takes O(n*log(n)) Time
In Second Part we BINARYSEARCH the Value in Array over a loop so 
net Complexity will be O(n) * O(log(n)) => O(n*log(n))


Input:
n <= Total no of students 
Array defining a student structure with entry/exit time 
people <= [(entry, exit), ...] 

no_of_pairs <= 0

Apply MERGESORT on people Array

FOR i from 0 to n - 1:
    val <= people[i].exit
    found_index <= binary_search_exit(people, val)
    Increment no_of_pairs by found_ind1ex - i


Algorithm MERGESORT: Time Complexity O(n*log(n))
MERGESORT(arr[], l,  r)
IF l == r
    return
ELSE
    Find the middle point to divide the array into two halves:  
        middle m <= (l+r)/2
    Do MERGESORT for first half:
        Call MERGESORT(arr, l, m)
    Do MERGESORT for second half:
        Call mergeSort(arr, m+1, r)
    MERGE the two halves sorted in step 2 and 3:
        Call MERGE(arr, l, m, r)


Algorithm MERGE: Time Complexity O(n)
MERGE(Array1, Array2):
Create a Duplicate array of Total Length:
    Temp <= Array of Size [ Array1.Length + Array2.Length ]
    index <= 0
Initialize Index for both Array:
    i <= 0, j <= 0

WHILE index < Temp.Length:
    IF any Array becomes empty
        IF i == Array1.Length :
            Temp[index++] <= Array2[j++]
        IF j == Array2.Length :
            Temp[index++] <= Array1[i++]
        CONTINUE

    INSERT the lower Element:
    IF Array1[i] < Array2[j]:
        Temp[index++] <= Array1[i++]
    ELSE
        Temp[index++] <= Array2[j++]



Algorithm BINARYSEARCH: Time Complexity O(log(n))
This Program will search for the greatest no. less than or equal
to the Value given in the Sorted Array

BINARYSEARCH(Array, val)
l <= 0, r <= Array.Length -1

WHILE l < r:
    GET Middle Element and compare with val
        mid <= l + (r - l) / 2;
        IF val is less than Array[mid]:
            SEARCH for val in right half of sorted Array:
                l <= mid + 1
        ELSE
            SEARCH for val in left half of sorted Array:
                r <= mid
IF Array[l] == val:
    RETURN l
ELSE
    RETURN l - 1

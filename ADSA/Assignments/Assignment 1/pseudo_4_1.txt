Algorithm I: Time Complexity O(n)
This Program will Search the Array for the least element and will return it
The Algorithm Uses a Single Loop in which we will match each element
with the minimum element and update the minimum element if turns out to be smaller

Input:
n <= total no of students 
arr <= [...]  Array of Numbers

DEFINE first element as the least
    int min = arr[0]

FOR i from 1 to n:
    IF arr[i] is less than min:
        DEFINE min as arr[i]
            min <= arr[i]

RETURN min
